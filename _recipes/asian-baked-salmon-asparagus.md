tags: maincourse, fish, weeknight

ingredients:
- 2 salmon steaks, de-boned (skinless if possible)
- 300 g asparagus
- 100 ml soy sauce
- 1 tbsp honey
- Pinch of garlic, powdered
- Pinch of black/white sesame seeds

directions:
- Preheat oven to 180C top/bottom heat (not convection).
- Place the salmon in an oven-safe dish, with baking paper if you want to make clean-up easier. If you didn't get skinless salmon, place skin-side down.
- Mix the soy sauce, honey and garlic in a small bowl. Brush the salmon with the marinade generously, leaving plenty in the bowl for afterwards.
- Cook the salmon in the oven for 18-22 minutes (depending on thickness), until slightly brown on top but not overdone. Every 5-6 minutes, take the salmon out briefly and re-apply the marinade (save some for the asparagus).
- While the salmon bakes, wash the asparagus and cut around 1 cm off the bottoms. Place on a baking tray, brush with the remaining marinade and place with the salmon in the oven so they bake for 9-11 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and serve.
