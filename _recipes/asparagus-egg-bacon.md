ingredients:
- 500 g asparagus
- 60 g bacon, in bits
- 2 eggs
- Pinch of coarse sea salt

directions:
- Preheat oven to 200C.
- Wash asparagus and chop of around 1 cm from the bottoms. Place on a baking tray with baking paper, season with sea salt and pepper. Bake for 7-9 minutes until slightly browned; asparagus can be pierced with a fork without too much effort.
- While baking, fry the bacon bits in the frying pan until crispy. Remove the bacon and strain the oil, putting the pan back on the stove and frying the eggs sunny-side up.
- Serve all together, with the egg on top or as desired. Season to taste.
