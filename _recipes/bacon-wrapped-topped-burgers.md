ingredients:
- 400 g ground beef, minced
- 1 red bell pepper
- 5-6 mushrooms
- 6-8 slices of bacon
- 2 tbsp mustard, mild
- 1 egg
- 100 g mozzarella or cheddar cheese, grated

directions:
- Preheat oven to 200C.
- Cut the bell pepper and mushrooms into rough cubes of 1 cm.
- Mix the ground beef with mushrooms, bell pepper, mustard and egg. Season well. Form into burger patties (2-3).
- Place the patties well-spaced on a baking tray with baking paper or a deep dish.
- Wrap each patty around the edge (horizontally) with bacon strips, pulling a little tight. Make a thumb imprint in the center of the patty.
- Bake the burgers for roughly 10-12 minutes, until they start to brown on top and the bacon is beginning to crisp. 
- Remove the burgers from the oven and sprinkle the cheese on top. Finish baking until the cheese has melted fully.

This masterpiece was born on a gaming night with NyanClan. They're very filling, so best to only make one or two per person. Served with crispy fries they are delicious.
