ingredients:
- 1 onion (½ for patty, ½ for gravy)
- 400 g beef
- 3 eggs (2 for topping + 1 for the patty)
- 2 tbsp milk
- 1 tsp worcestershire sauce
- 1 cup of rice (preferably sticky)
- ½ tsp nutmeg
- ½ tbsp olive oil
- 350 ml beef stock
- 1 tsp soy sauce

directions:
- Start boiling the rice. 
- Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large pan on medium-high heat and sauté the onion until translucent.
- Turn off the heat and divide the sautéed onion in half (half for the gravy and half for the patty).
- In a large bowl, add the meat and half of the sautéed onion. Add an egg, the milk, worcestershire sauce, nutmeg, some salt and black pepper.
- Mix the meat well until the mixture gets sticky and pale, and then divide into 2 patties.
- Make 2 oval shaped large patties. The top should be slightly round and not flat. Keep the patties in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before cooking so that the meat combines together.
- In a large pan, heat ½ tbsp olive oil over medium heat and place the patties on the pan. Indent the center of each patty with 2 fingers to prevent bulging. Cook the patties for about 5 minutes. Do not flip until the bottom of the patties is nicely browned. Cover and cook for 5 minutes to thoroughly cook the inside of the patties (adjust cooking time depending on thickness). 
- Fry the eggs until nicely crispy, sunny-side up.
- For the gravy - heat ½ tbsp olive oil in a small saucepan on medium heat and mix in the sautéed onion. Add 1½ cup beef stock, 1 tsp worcestershire sauce, and 1 tsp soy sauce. Cook until nicely thick.
- Serve steamed rice on individual plates. Transfer the patties to the plates, pour the gravy, and top with a fried egg. Serve immediately.
