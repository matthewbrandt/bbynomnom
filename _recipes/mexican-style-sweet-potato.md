ingredients:
- 600-700 g sweet potato (2 potatoes)
- 1 avocado
- 1 small can of corn
- 1 large can of kidney beans
- 2 fresh tomatoes
- 350 ml of sour cream or creme fraiche
- 3 stems of fresh coriander
- 3 cups of orange cheddar cheese
- Mexican spices to taste (paprika powder, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin powder, onion powder, salt, pepper)
- 2 squeezes of lemon juice
- (optional) 1 small can of black beans

directions:
- Preheat oven to 180C.
- Wash the sweet potato, cut off the ends and slice it lengthwise in half. Brush both sides with some olive oil and place flat-side down on a baking tray with baking paper. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the skin crinkles and some of the juice is leaking out.
- While the sweet potato is cooking, open and de-pit the avocado and put the fruit flesh in a bowl. Add ¼ of sour cream / creme fraiche and a little lemon juice, some paprika, salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
- Open the kidney beans and corn (optionally the black beans). Strain and rinse under cold water until the water is clear.
- Heat up a small frying pan and on middle heat, cook the beans and corn, adding the mexican spice mix with a tbsp of water if too dry. After the mix is hot, set aside and keep warm.
- Slice the tomatoes in half, remove the stems and dice into small cubes. Place in a bowl. Add salt, pepper and squeeze of lemon juice. 
- Remove the coriander leaves from the stem and chop finely, leaving 2 leaves for decoration. Add to the tomato bowl and mix. Set aside.
- When the sweet potatoes are cooked, flip each piece over and place flesh-side up on the baking tray. Sprinkle ½ the cheese over the sweet potato and place back in the oven for 2-3 minutes.
- Finally, place the sweet potatoes on the plates. Cover in the beans and corn, then the tomato salsa, then the avocado guacamole. Top with the rest of the sour cream/creme fraiche and cheddar, place the coriander leaf for decoration.
